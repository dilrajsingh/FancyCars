# Fancy Cars

## About
```
This application shows a list of 10 "Fancy Cars" retreived from a mock
databse that can be sorted based on the "name" or "availability".
Depending on the "availability" of the car the button to buy it will be
enabled or disabled.

This demonstrates my skills in React-Redux Thunk and Express.js, Node.js.

At this time this application has not yet been deployed but should be
by the end of November! In the mean time feel free to install it.
